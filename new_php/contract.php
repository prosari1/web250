        <h3>COURSE CONTRACT</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          I, <a href="introduction.php">Patricia Rosario</a> agree to abide by
          the terms of the course contract in my Spring semester 2022, WEB
          250-N801 Database Driven Websites with my instructor, D.I. vonBriesen.
        </p>
        <p>
          I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal website
          will be publicly available to the world, and will not put information
          there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep
          private.
        </p>

        <p>
          I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not
          logins or showing up for class.
        </p>
        <p>As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.</p>
        <br />
